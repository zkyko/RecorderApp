      "response": "Based on the test failure logs, I can see that the warehouse transfer test failed at step 5 when trying to select a warehouse location. The error indicates that the locator `page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Transfer' })` couldn't find the element.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe Transfer button appears to be conditionally rendered based on form state. The button may only appear after certain fields are filled or the form is in a specific state.\n\n**Recommended Fix:**\n1. Add a wait condition before clicking the Transfer button:\n```typescript\nawait page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Transfer' }).waitFor({ state: 'visible' });\nawait page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Transfer' }).click();\n```\n\n2. Alternatively, verify the form state before attempting to transfer:\n```typescript\nawait expect(page.getByText('Ready to transfer')).toBeVisible();\nawait page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Transfer' }).click();\n```\n\n**Additional Suggestions:**\n- Check if there are any validation messages preventing the transfer\n- Verify all required fields are filled before the transfer step\n- Consider adding explicit waits for D365 form state changes"

      "response": "The test failed with a timeout error: `page.getByLabel('Payment amount') did not appear within 30000ms`.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nThe Payment amount field is likely inside a dialog or sub-form that takes time to load. The field may not be immediately available when the page loads.\n\n**Recommended Fix:**\n1. Wait for the payment dialog/form to be visible first:\n```typescript\nawait page.getByRole('dialog', { name: 'Payment' }).waitFor({ state: 'visible' });\nawait page.getByLabel('Payment amount').fill('1000.00');\n```\n\n2. Or use a more specific locator that waits for the element:\n```typescript\nawait page.getByLabel('Payment amount', { exact: false }).waitFor({ state: 'visible', timeout: 10000 });\nawait page.getByLabel('Payment amount').fill('1000.00');\n```\n\n**Additional Suggestions:**\n- Check if there's a loading indicator that should be waited for\n- Verify the payment form is opened correctly before filling fields\n- Consider using D365 control name locators for more reliability"

All steps executed without errors.\n\n**Performance Notes:**\n- Total execution time: 2 minutes 10 seconds\n- All locators were found quickly\n- No timing issues detected\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Consider parameterizing the customer account and item numbers for better test coverage\n- Add assertions to verify the sales order was created with correct values\n- The test could benefit from data-driven testing with multiple datasets"
